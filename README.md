# Web Development Project â€“ Team & Feedback Pages

Welcome to the repository for a collaborative web development project created as part of our academic coursework. The overall website includes various sections such as Home, Services, and About, built by different team members.

##  My Contribution

This repository contains my individual contribution to the project, specifically:

- ðŸ”¹ **Team Page** â€“ A section that showcases the project members, their roles, and brief bios in a clean and structured format.
- ðŸ”¹ **Feedback Page** â€“ An interactive form where users can submit feedback or comments, including basic form validation and responsive design.

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (basic form validation, if any)

##  How to Use

You can download or clone the repository and open the `team.html` or `feedback.html` file in any modern web browser to view the pages.
